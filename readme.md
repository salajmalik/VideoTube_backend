# Welcome To VideoTube Repository

This project is the backend component of a video hosting website, akin to Youtube. It's developed using **Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Cloudinary, JWT, bcrypt,** and other technologies.

The website provides features such as **User authentication (login, signup), video uploading, playlist management, rating (like, dislike), commenting, tweeting(similar to community posts of youtube), subscription management,** and more.

The project adheres to industry-standard practices including **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication, **bcrypt** for password hashing, access tokens, refresh tokens, and more.
